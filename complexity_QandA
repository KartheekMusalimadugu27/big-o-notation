#Complexity Interview Questions#

1) What are the two main measures for the efficiency of an algorithm?
 
 Time and Space (Time refers to the runtime efficiency of the algorithm. Space refers to the amount of memory your alogrithm reuqires)
 
 2) What is Time Complexity?
 
 Measuring the efficiency of an algorithm by counting the number of key operations.
 
 3) What is Space complexity?
 
 Measuring efficiency of algorithm by counting maximum memory needed by algorithm
 
 4) Which of the following does NOT belong to the family of notations?
 
 Big (|><|)
 
 5) Which of the following describes the worst, 'Average', 'Best' case scenario?

 Any notation can be used to describe the best case, worst case, or average case. The notations are not tied to any of the cases.
